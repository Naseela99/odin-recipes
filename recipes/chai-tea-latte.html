        <p>
           Chai or as it's famous at Starbucks as <em>"Chai Tea Latte"</em> is a beverage that has originated in India. It is a flavourful combination of English breakfast tea
           and exotic spices. Like coffee, some people don't start their day without a cup of Chai. In combination with bread-butter, cookies or even even crackers it is a 
           complete meal for some. So, let's start brewing the most amazing beverage!
